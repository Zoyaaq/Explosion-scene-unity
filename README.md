# Explosion-scene-unity
This is an assignment in which I have implemented a game physics concept of explosion in unity. A small recreation of a grenade explosion scene from a movie is done by me, with this explanation and implementation video attached below. I have also uploaded the scripts which I used in developing the scene in Unity Engine.
